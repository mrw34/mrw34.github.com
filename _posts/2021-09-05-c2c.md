## Notes

- Total distance of 230km with 2925m of climbing ([GPX](C2C.gpx))
- This route provides a decent balance: the first day being the longest, the second the hilliest, and the last providing enough time for onward travel
- Suitable preparation is riding at least 100km over undulating terrain in a single day
- The route has two deviations from the [conventional C2C](https://cycle.travel/map/journey/75):
  - Avoids Whinlatter Forest, which is only recommended for off-road bikes (not hybrids)
  - Passes through via St John's Chapel rather than Rookhope due to availability of accommdation
