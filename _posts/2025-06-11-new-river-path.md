The [New River Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_River_Path) is a long-distance footpath following the course of the New River, a 17th-century aqueduct.

The Hertfordshire and London sections cover the first 25 miles of the watercourse, before it disappears underground.

Note that as of writing (June 2025) there are two significant diversions included that are missing from most published maps:
- The King's Meads railway crossing near the start of the walk to have been permanently closed by Network Rail - the nearest alternative is on Mead Lane
- The section after the Google data centre near Waltham Cross has been closed by Thames Water - their suggested diversion is via the footpath alongside the A10

These diversions are included on the map below. There are also some minor, temporary diversions near Bull's Cross due to resurfacing work on the path but these are relatively easy to navigate.
